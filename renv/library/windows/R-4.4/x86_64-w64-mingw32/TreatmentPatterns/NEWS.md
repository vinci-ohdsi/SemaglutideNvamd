# TreatmentPatterns 3.0.0
---------
* Save parameters from `computePathways()` and `export()`
* A `TreatmentPatternsResults` (TPR) object is now returned from `export()`
* Updated output file and column names to be snake_case rather than camelCase
  * The TPR object houses all the different tables, and has methods for plotting.
  * Writing CSV-files on `export()` is now optional (`export(outputPath = "some/path/")`)
  * The TPR object has the following methods: `saveAsCsv()`, `saveAsZip()`, `uploadResultsToDb()`, `load()`, `plotSunburst()`, `plotSankey()`, `plotEventDuration()` 
  * The TPR object has the following fields:, `attrition`, `metadata`, `treatment_pathways`, `summary_event_duration`, `counts_age`, `counts_sex`, `counts_year`, `cdm_source_info`, `analyses`, `arguments`
* Added `ResultModelManager` support
* Multiple `target` cohorts are now supported
* Allow `target`, `event`, and `exit` cohorts to be in different tables
* Stratification is now optional `export(stratify = TRUE)`
* When data is pulled from the database, subjects are assigned a new subject ID. This prevents rounding subject ID's, and unintentional grouping of subjects.

# TreatmentPatterns 2.7.0
---------
* Converted subject_id's to pseudo_subject_id's when pulling in data from the database. Actual subject_id's are stored as `character()`.

* Added life cycle badge to ReadMe
* Added more informative error / warning messaging when no data is available to compute pathways.
* Extended output for event duration in pathways.
* Renamed `summaryStatsTherapyDuration.csv` to `summaryEventDuration.csv`.
* Updated status messaging in the console.
* Added `attrition.csv` that capture status messaging and time stamps. 
*

* Fixed CRAN error when running examples.
* Renamed `cellCount` to `minCellCount` in export documentation.
* Fixed issue where counts of pathways were not computed correctly.
* Fixed spelling error `summaryStatsTherapyDuraion` to `summaryStatsTherapyDuration`.

# TreatmentPatterns 2.6.1
